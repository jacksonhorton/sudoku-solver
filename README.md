# sudoku-solver
My first ever js program. Don't judge too bad (;
# How to use
Download the files and open the html file in any browser. Right now, all of the magic happens in the developer console. You access this on some browsers by right-clicking and selecting inspect. Then navigate to console.
# To-do
1. Make an easy method to input a new sudoku puzzle.
2. Make a better output that is more visual and doesn't require the console.
